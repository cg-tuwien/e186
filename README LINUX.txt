-- CHANGES MADE --

+ fixed UTF-16LE encoding in source files generated by visual studio, converted to ascii
Visual Studio in newer versions seems to produce files in UTF-16LE. this is completely unnecessary for source files which should be ASCII only anyway and brings many compatibility issues with other platforms. make sure to convert source files to US-ASCII or ISO/IEC 8859-1 or even UTF-8 using iconv or just copy the code to new files.

+ setup cmakelists, cmake modules to find external libs etc.
+ fixed glm/simd/platform.h to include option for gcc 7.3 (only had 7.2 or earlier or 8)
https://github.com/g-truc/glm/issues/728
+ using cotire cmake module to have "e186.h" as a precompiled prefix header (code inserted at beginning of every file) like visual studio does with the stdafx.h which in this case includes e186.h. without this, lots and lots of #includes would be missing in all files.

+ fixed some small bugs gcc complained about that apparently visual studio doesnt care about (visual studio doesnt seem to care much about the c++ standard)
+ cmake add_definitions(-DGLFW_INCLUDE_NONE) to add #define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE, since GLAD provides OpenGL headers, GLFW shouldnt include them again
